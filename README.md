# Brigalow

Open-source, self-hosted signing control plane. Build systems send a digest; Brigalow checks who is asking and whether policy allows it, has a key in an HSM sign it, and keeps a tamper-evident record.

> **Status: Phases 0–1 implemented.** Config, health checks, tenant-scoped persistence and offline audit-chain verification are available. OIDC identity, scoped tokens and initial administration pages are available. Signing remains unimplemented; nothing here is ready to sign real software. Don't deploy it to production. Work is tracked in [issues](https://github.com/yumaitau/brigalow/issues) and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Why

Signing keys still end up on build agents and laptops. Commercial signing platforms fix that, but the only open-source signing server with a long history (SignServer Community Edition) dropped HSM support in 7.7.1 and is labelled non-production. Brigalow aims to be a production-intended, HSM-first option you can run yourself, including air-gapped.

## What it will do

- Keep private keys in an HSM (PKCS#11) or KMS. No export.
- Accept digests only; artifacts stay on the build machine.
- Authenticate humans with OIDC and CI jobs with OIDC workload tokens, matched against rules (repo, branch, workflow, environment).
- Enforce signing policies with a test or release purpose, async k-of-n approvals where one deny rejects, release windows with signature caps, and fail-closed pre-sign gates.
- Produce raw signatures and detached CMS with RFC 3161 timestamps; later a PKCS#11 module so existing tools (osslsigncode, jsign, cosign, GPG) work unchanged.
- Record every step in a hash-chained audit log you can verify offline.

## What it won't do

Brigalow is not a certificate authority and can't make a signature publicly trusted. Public trust (Windows SmartScreen, macOS Gatekeeper and similar) needs a certificate from a public CA after identity validation, usually with a fee and certified key hardware. Brigalow can put policy, approvals and audit in front of such a key, but the trust comes from the CA. See [docs/product/scope.md](docs/product/scope.md).

## Build

Requires stable Rust (CI uses the current stable release), OpenSSL, Python 3 and Docker Compose for integration tests.

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
# Use your explicitly selected local Docker context (e.g. orbstack on macOS).
scripts/e2e.sh --context orbstack
```

The end-to-end harness creates disposable Postgres and SoftHSM2 containers, generates passwords and TLS keys at runtime, runs acceptance tests, starts the server, checks health and secret redaction, then removes its containers, image, network and temporary files. It does not enrol with a CA or contact a signing service. See [local development](docs/development.md) for configuration and database setup.

Verify a single-organisation audit export offline:

```bash
cargo run -p brig -- audit verify export.jsonl
```

This checks chain integrity. Signed checkpoints and protection against whole-chain replacement or suffix truncation are not implemented yet.
