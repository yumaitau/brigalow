# Brigalow

Open-source, self-hosted signing control plane. Build systems send a digest; Brigalow checks who is asking and whether policy allows it, has a key in an HSM sign it, and keeps a tamper-evident record.

> **Status: implementation spans Phases 0–9; phase issues track local and hosted acceptance gates.** Implemented: OIDC/RBAC, tenant isolation, HSM/lab key custody, digest signing and CMS/timestamps, approvals, release windows, gates, provenance, native-tool integrations, optional private CA, rate limits, signed audit checkpoints and recovery drills. Phase 9 adds a local CSC mock only. See [phase issues](https://github.com/yumaitau/brigalow/issues) for the authoritative completion evidence. This remains development software; no production deployment or real CA integration has been performed.

## Why

Signing keys still end up on build agents and laptops. Commercial signing platforms fix that, but the only open-source signing server with a long history (SignServer Community Edition) dropped HSM support in 7.7.1 and is labelled non-production. Brigalow aims to be a production-intended, HSM-first option you can run yourself, including air-gapped.

## Capabilities

- Keep private keys in an HSM through PKCS#11. Software keys are lab-only; cloud KMS backends remain future work. No export.
- Accept digests only; artifacts stay on the build machine.
- Authenticate humans with OIDC and CI jobs with OIDC workload tokens, matched against rules (repo, branch, workflow, environment).
- Enforce signing policies with a test or release purpose, async k-of-n approvals where one deny rejects, release windows with signature caps, and fail-closed pre-sign gates.
- Produce raw signatures and detached CMS with RFC 3161 timestamps; a PKCS#11 module so existing tools (osslsigncode, jsign, cosign, GPG) work unchanged.
- Record every step in a hash-chained audit log you can verify offline.

## What it won't do

Brigalow's optional private CA supports self-hosted trust. Brigalow cannot act as a public CA or make a signature publicly trusted. Public trust (Windows SmartScreen, macOS Gatekeeper and similar) needs a certificate from a public CA after identity validation, usually with a fee and certified key hardware. Brigalow can put policy, approvals and audit in front of such a key, but the trust comes from the CA. See [docs/product/scope.md](docs/product/scope.md).

## Build

Requires stable Rust (CI uses the current stable release), OpenSSL, Python 3 and Docker Compose for integration tests.

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
# Use your explicitly selected local Docker context (e.g. orbstack on macOS).
scripts/e2e.sh --context orbstack
```

The end-to-end harness creates disposable Postgres and SoftHSM2 containers, generates passwords and TLS keys at runtime, runs acceptance tests, starts the server, checks health and secret redaction, then removes its containers, image, network and temporary files. It does not enrol with a CA or contact a signing service. See [local development](docs/development.md) for configuration and database setup.

Verify a single-organisation audit export offline:

```bash
cargo run -p brig -- audit verify export.jsonl
```

This checks chain integrity. Add `--checkpoint checkpoint.json --public-key trusted.der` to authenticate an exact exported prefix against an independently pinned audit key. Retain the latest signed head outside the signing host to detect rollback. See [operations](docs/operations.md).
